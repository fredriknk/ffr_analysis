FFR Analysis Program
=======================================
_Written by Lars Molstad_

The FFR analysis program is a python based interpreter for files generated by the Field Flux Robot. 

The program is structured in the following way:

```
ffr_analysis
│   README.md   
└───Prog  #DO NOT CHANGE
│      
└───example_data  #example data for testing of regression functions without actual FFR data
|   │   file021.txt
|
└───Users #Individual folders for each use case of the program 
    |
    └───E22 
    |
    └───Elisabeth
    |
    └───Erin
    |
    └───LarsM
    |
    └───Shahid
    |
    └───Sigrid  #Capture project
```

Where each user folder will represent a specific field or method for analysing data. 

If downloading the FFR analysis program for the first time, a few things have to be done before you can run the program. 
1. Download the Anaconda package with spyder IDE
2. Clone the ffr_analysis repo
3. Find your specific folder and put your raw data files in the raw_data folder 
4. Create a file with a raw_data_path.ino file with the path to your raw data
